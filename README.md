4. **Consistent Stlying**: A consistent color scheme, typography, and overall style are maintained throughout the portfolio to establish a brand.

5. **User-Friendly Navigation**: The navigation menu is kept simple and intuitive. Users can easily access different sections of the portfolio, such as About Me, Projects, and Contact.
